{"description":"<p>Apply a jitter effect for the rendered markers. When plotting\ndiscrete values, a little random noise may help telling the points\napart. The jitter setting applies a random displacement of up to <code>n</code>\naxis units in either direction. So for example on a horizontal X\naxis, setting the <code>jitter.x</code> to 0.24 will render the point in a\nrandom position between 0.24 units to the left and 0.24 units to the\nright of the true axis position. On a category axis, setting it to\n0.5 will fill up the bin and make the data appear continuous.</p>\n<p>When rendered on top of a box plot or a column series, a jitter value\nof 0.24 will correspond to the underlying series&#39; default\n<a href=\"https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.groupPadding\">groupPadding</a>\nand <a href=\"https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.pointPadding\">pointPadding</a>\nsettings.</p>\n","samples":[{"name":"Jitter on a scatter plot","value":"highcharts/series-scatter/jitter","products":["highcharts"]},{"name":"Jittered scatter plot on top of a box plot","value":"highcharts/series-scatter/jitter-boxplot","products":["highcharts"]}],"typeList":{"names":["*"]},"children":[{"name":"x","fullname":"series.scatter3d.jitter.x","isLeaf":true,"default":0,"typeMap":{"number":1},"typeList":{"names":["number"]},"description":"<p>The maximal X offset for the random jitter effect.</p>\n","since":"7.0.2","filename":"js/Series/Scatter/ScatterSeries.js","line":165,"lineEnd":167,"version":"fa929aa027"},{"name":"y","fullname":"series.scatter3d.jitter.y","isLeaf":true,"default":0,"typeMap":{"number":1},"typeList":{"names":["number"]},"description":"<p>The maximal Y offset for the random jitter effect.</p>\n","since":"7.0.2","filename":"js/Series/Scatter/ScatterSeries.js","line":169,"lineEnd":171,"version":"fa929aa027"}]}
