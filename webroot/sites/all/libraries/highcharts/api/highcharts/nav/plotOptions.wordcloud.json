When false, the <code>mouseOut</code> event on a series is\ntriggered when the mouse leaves the area around the series&#39; graph or\nmarkers. This also implies the tooltip when not shared. When\n<code>stickyTracking</code> is false and <code>tooltip.shared</code> is false, the tooltip\nwill be hidden when moving the mouse between series. Defaults to true\nfor line and area type series, but to false for columns, pies etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The boost module will force this option because of\ntechnical limitations.</p>\n","since":"2.0.0","samples":[{"name":"True by default","value":"highcharts/plotoptions/series-stickytracking-true/","products":["highcharts"]},{"name":"False","value":"highcharts/plotoptions/series-stickytracking-false/","products":["highcharts"]}],"filename":"js/Series/Column/ColumnSeries.js","line":935,"lineEnd":935,"version":"fa929aa027"},{"name":"style","fullname":"plotOptions.wordcloud.style","isLeaf":true,"default":"{\"fontFamily\":\"sans-serif\", \"fontWeight\": \"900\"}","typeMap":{"Highcharts.CSSObject":1},"typeList":{"names":["Highcharts.CSSObject"]},"description":"<p>CSS styles for the words.</p>\n","since":"6.0.0","filename":"js/Series/Wordcloud/WordcloudSeries.js","line":361,"lineEnd":366,"version":"fa929aa027"},{"name":"tooltip","fullname":"plotOptions.wordcloud.tooltip","isLeaf":false,"typeMap":{"*":1},"typeList":{"names":["*"]},"description":"<p>A configuration object for the tooltip rendering of each single\nseries.
