Points are assigned\nto squares of set size depending on their position on the plot\narea. Points inside the grid square are combined into a cluster.\nThe grid size can be controlled by <code>gridSize</code> property\n(grid size changes at certain zoom levels).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>kmeans</code> - based on K-Means clustering technique. In the\nfirst step, points are divided using the grid method (distance\nproperty is a grid size) to find the initial amount of clusters.\nNext, each point is classified by computing the distance between\neach cluster center and that point. When the closest cluster\ndistance is lower than distance property set by a user the point\nis added to this cluster otherwise is classified as <code>noise</code>. The\nalgorithm is repeated until each cluster center not change its\nprevious position more than one pixel. This technique is more\naccurate but also more time consuming than the <code>grid</code> algorithm,\nespecially for big datasets.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>optimizedKmeans</code> - based on K-Means clustering technique. This\nalgorithm uses k-means algorithm only on the chart initialization\nor when chart extremes have greater range than on initialization.\nWhen a chart is redrawn the algorithm checks only clustered points\ndistance from the cluster center and rebuild it when the point is\nspaced enough to be outside the cluster. It provides performance\nimprovement and more stable clusters position yet can be used rather\non small and sparse datasets.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By default, the algorithm depends on visible quantity of points\nand <code>kmeansThreshold</code>.
