{"description":"<p>A configuration object to define how the color of a child varies from\nthe parent&#39;s color. The variation is distributed among the children\nof node. For example when setting brightness, the brightness change\nwill range from the parent&#39;s original brightness on the first child,\nto the amount set in the <code>to</code> setting on the last node. This allows a\ngradient-like color scheme that sets children out from each other\nwhile highlighting the grouping on treemaps and sectors on sunburst\ncharts.</p>\n","samples":[{"name":"Sunburst with color variation","value":"highcharts/demo/sunburst/"}],"typeList":{"names":["*"]},"children":[{"name":"key","fullname":"plotOptions.treemap.levels.colorVariation.key","isLeaf":true,"typeMap":{"string":1},"typeList":{"names":["string"]},"description":"<p>The key of a color variation.
