EPA,Environmental Protection Agency,http://www.epa.gov,,"EPA works to ensure that:   	All Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn and work; 	National efforts to reduce environmental risk are based on the best available scientific information; 	Federal laws protecting human health and the environment are enforced fairly and effectively; 	Environmental protection is an integral consideration in U.S. policies concerning natural resources, human health, economic growth, energy, transportation, agriculture, industry, and international trade, and these factors are similarly considered in establishing environmental policy; 	All parts of society - communities, individuals, businesses, and state, local and tribal governments - have access to accurate information sufficient to effectively participate in managing human health and environmental risks; 	Environmental protection contributes to making our communities and ecosystems diverse, sustainable and economically productive; and 	The U.S. plays a leadership role in working with other nations to protect the global environment.      EPA’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan provides a blueprint for advancing the Administrator's themes and the Agency’s mission.  Issued in April 2014, the Plan identifies the measurable environmental and human health outcomes the public can expect over the next five years and describes how we intend to achieve those results.  It sets forth five strategic goals for achieving these outcomes and four cross-agency strategies for changing the way the Agency works to achieve its results.   Goal 1: Addressing Climate Change and Improving Air Quality  Goal 2: Protecting America’s Waters  Goal 3: Cleaning Up Communities and Advancing Sustainable Development  Goal 4: Ensuring the Safety of Chemicals and Preventing Pollution  Goal 5: Protecting Human Health and the Environment by Enforcing  Laws and Assuring Compliance  Strategy 1: Working Toward a Sustainable Future  Strategy 2: Working to Make a Visible Difference in Communities  Strategy 3: Launching a New Era of State, Tribal, Local, and International Partnerships  Strategy 4: Embracing EPA as a High-Performing Organization  The cross-agency strategy action plans provide more specific information on how EPA is implementing these strategies.  EPA’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan also identifies the Agency’s FY 2014-2015 priority goals and the Agency has now established FY 2016-2017 priority goals. EPA’s priority goals advance the strategic goals in the Strategic Plan and are specific, measurable, and achievable within 18 to 24 months.  These goals serve as near-term indicators of progress in key programmatic areas and have been established by the Administration as a central focus of its performance management framework.

HHS,Department of Health and Human Services,http://www.hhs.gov,,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves.  HHS represents almost a quarter of all federal outlays and administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined. HHS’s Medicare program is the nation’s largest health insurer, handling more than 1 billion claims per year. Medicare and Medicaid together provide health care insurance for one in four Americans.  HHS works closely with state and local governments, and many HHS-funded services are provided at the local level by state or county agencies, or through private sector grantees. The Department supports more than 300 programs, covering a wide spectrum of activities administered by 11 operating divisions. In addition to delivering services, HHS programs support the collection of health data and provide for the equitable treatment in health care and human service settings. The Department’s activities include:   	Health, biomedical, and social science research; 	Health promotion and community-based health programs; 	Disease prevention, including immunization services; 	Assuring food and drug safety; 	Health insurance for Americans, including elderly and disabled Americans, individuals with pre-existing conditions, low-income people and others through Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Health Insurance Exchanges, Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plans and other programs; 	Health information technology; 	Public health infrastructure; 	Financial assistance and services for low-income families; 	Maternal and infant health programs; 	Early childhood development programs; 	Child abuse and domestic violence prevention; 	Substance abuse and mental health services; 	Services for older Americans, including home-delivered meals; 	Comprehensive health services for Native Americans; and 	Medical preparedness for emergencies, including potential terrorism.   With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, HHS has been moving forward to implement the law and help improve the health of millions of Americans. The law puts in place comprehensive reforms that protect Americans from the worst insurance company abuses, makes health insurance more affordable, provides better access to care and coverage, and strengthens Medicare.  For example, HHS is working with states to establish new transparent and competitive insurance marketplaces called Affordable Insurance Exchanges where, beginning in 2014, individuals and small businesses can compare their coverage options and buy affordable health coverage. Additionally, many important benefits and protections have already gone into effect, helping millions get the coverage they need and putting Americans back in charge of their health care. Because of the law:   	Young adults can stay on their parent’s plan until age 26, 	Health plans cannot limit or deny benefits or deny coverage for a child younger than age 19 because of a pre-existing condition, 	A health insurance policy cannot be canceled because of a simple mistake on an application, and lifetime dollar limits on most benefits are banned for all new health insurance plans, and 	New standards for medical loss ratio and rate review ensure consumers get value for their premium dollars and that proposed rate increases are based on reasonable cost assumptions and solid evidence.   Transforming the health care system, which includes implementing the Affordable Care Act, is a cornerstone of the HHS Strategic Plan. The current Strategic Plan outlines HHS’s main objectives and performance measures to monitor our progress. Additional metrics are available in the HHS Online Performance Appendix.  To ensure public access and transparency, HHS launched www.HealthCare.gov on July 1, 2010. The site has been visited more than 10 million times since it launched. The site includes extensive, easy to understand information about the health care law, including new rights and protections, coverage options, and how the Affordable Care Act will help consumers.  The website is the first of its kind to bring information and links to health insurance plans and other coverage options into one place, making it easy for consumers to learn about their insurance choices. And on November 18, 2011, HHS added a unique tool to allow small businesses to research and compare locally available insurance plans in an unbiased manner. As a result, small businesses now have easy access to plan data, such as out-of-pocket limits, average cost per enrollee, available deductibles and co-pay options (including services that are not covered and benefits available for purchase at additional costs), Health Savings Account eligibility, and more.  HealthCare.gov also gives consumers the tools they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their families, like information about rate increases. HealthCare.gov also provides details about the 80-20 rule (which requires insurers to spend at least 80 cents of every dollar on customers’ health care or quality improvements to it). A Spanish language version of the website (www.cuidadodesalud.gov) was launched on September 8, 2010.  In order to ensure a robust system of monitoring and evaluation as well as government transparency and accountability, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has designed a Health System Tracking Project. The Health System Tracking Project is a dynamic, web-based tool that displays data on key health indicators, compiled from across federal sources, along with descriptions of the measures and links to data sources. Good metrics will allow policymakers, providers and the public to monitor changes in health care quality, cost and access and enable them to understand the effects of these changes across the health care system.  In keeping with its commitment to transparency and accountability, HHS launched a new 10-year agenda for Healthy People 2020 in December 2010. Healthy People 2020 represents the fourth generation of decade-long disease prevention and health promotion goals for the nation. Its science-based, measurable objectives benchmark the nation’s health at the beginning of the decade, set 10-year targets, and help monitor and track progress over time. Tracking data, interventions, and other resources are easily accessible at the redesigned healthypeople.gov website. HHS developed Healthy People 2020 through a collaborative process that drew on expertise and input across multiple Federal agencies, state and local governments, academia, business, community and professional organizations, and members of the public.

DHS,Department of Homeland Security,http://www.dhs.gov,,"The Department of Homeland Security has a vital mission: to secure the nation from the many threats we face. This requires the dedication of more than 240,000 employees in jobs that range from aviation and border security to emergency response, from cybersecurity analyst to chemical facility inspector. Our duties are wide-ranging, but our goal is clear - keeping America safe.      Performance Data Verification and Validation Process  The Department recognizes the importance of collecting complete, accurate, and reliable performance data since this helps determine progress toward achieving program and Department goals and objectives.  Performance data are considered reliable if transactions and other data that support reported performance measures are properly recorded, processed, and summarized to permit the preparation of performance information in accordance with criteria stated by management.  OMB Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements, OMB Circular A-11, and the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000  (P.L. No. 106-531) further delineate this responsibility by requiring agency heads to attest to the completeness and reliability of the performance data they report and put procedures in place to ensure valid data as part of the Management Assurance process.   DHS implemented a multi-pronged approach to effectively mitigate risks and reinforce processes that enhance the Department’s ability to report complete and reliable data for GPRAMA performance measure reporting.  This approach consists of the:  1) Performance Measure Definition Form (PMDF); 2) Performance Measure Checklist for Completeness and Reliability; and 3) annual assessments of the completeness and reliability of a sample of our performance measures by an independent review team.  Performance Measure Definition Form (PMDF)  The Office of the Chief Financial Officer/Program Analysis and Evaluation (CFO/PA&E) implemented a tool known as the PMDF that provides a structured format to operationally describe every measure we publicly report in our performance deliverables.  The PMDF provides instructions on completing all data fields and includes elements such as the measure name, description, scope of data included and excluded, where the data is collected and stored, a summary of the data collection and computation process, and what processes exist to double-check the accuracy of the data to ensure reliability. These data fields on the form reflect GAO’s recommended elements regarding data quality.  This information is maintained in a Department IT system, and is published annually as Appendix A to our Annual Performance Report.  The PMDF is also used as a change management tool to propose and review new measures, make changes to existing measures, and to retire measures we want to remove from our strategic and management measure sets.  GAO recently cited DHS’s thoroughness in collecting and reporting this information in their review of the quality of performance information in their report:  Managing for Results: Greater Transparency Needed in Public Reporting Quality of Performance Information for Selected Agencies’ Priority Goals (GAO-15-788).   Central Information Technology Repository for Performance Measure Information   All of DHS’s approved measures are maintained in a Department-wide system accessible to all relevant parties in DHS.  The system is a modular database which allows for the management of the Department’s performance plan and the capturing of performance results on a quarterly basis.  The system stores all historical information about each measure including specific details regarding:  scope; data source; data collection methodology; and explanation of data reliability check.  The data in the system is then used as the source for all quarterly and annual Performance and Accountability Reporting.  Finally, the performance data in the FYHSP System is used to populate the Department’s business intelligence tools to provide real-time information.    Performance Measure Checklist for Completeness and Reliability  The Performance Measure Checklist for Completeness and Reliability is a means for Component Performance Improvement Officers (PIOs) to attest to the quality of the information they are providing in our performance and accountability reports. Using the Checklist, Components self-evaluate key controls over GPRAMA performance measure planning and reporting actions at the end of each fiscal year. Components describe their control activities and provide a rating regarding their level of compliance and actions taken for each key control.  Components also factor the results of any internal or independent measure assessments into their rating.  The Checklist supports the Component Head assurance statements attesting to the completeness and reliability of performance data.  Individual Component Head assurance statements serve as the primary basis for the Secretary’s assertion whether or not the Department has effective controls over financial and performance reporting as well as efficiencies of our operations.  Independent Assessment of the Completeness and Reliability of Performance Measure Data  CFO/PA&E conducts an assessment of performance measure data for completeness and reliability on a subset of its performance measures annually using an independent review team.  An independent review team assesses selected Component GPRAMA measures using the methodology prescribed in the DHS Performance Measure Verification and Validation Handbook, documents their findings, makes recommendations for improvement, and may perform a subsequent follow-up review to observe the implementation of recommendations.  Corrective actions are required for performance measures determined to be unreliable.  The Handbook is distributed and made available to all Components to encourage the development and maturation of internal data verification and validation capabilities, increase transparency, and facilitate the review process.  The results obtained from the independent assessments are also used to support Component Head assertions over the reliability of its performance information reported in the Performance Measure Checklist and Component Head Assurance Statement.  DHS has shared our process with other Agencies in support of their measure data verification and validation improvement efforts.  Management Assurance Process for GPRAMA Performance Measure Information  The Management Assurance Process requires all Component Heads in DHS to assert that performance measure data reported in the Department’s Performance and Accountability Reports are complete and reliable.  If a measure is considered unreliable, the Component is directed to report the measure on the Performance Measure Checklist for Completeness and Reliability along with the corrective actions the Component is taking to correct the measure’s reliability.    "

DOT,Department of Transportation,http://www.dot.gov,,"Established in 1967 by Congress, DOT consolidated more than 30 transportation agencies and functions, including the U.S. Coast Guard, Bureau of Public Roads, and Federal Aviation Agency, under the first Secretary of Transportation Alan S. Boyd. Today, over 57,000 DOT employees work in the Offices of the Secretary of Transportation, the Office of the Inspector General, ten Operating Administrations, and the Surface Transportation Board.  The Operating Administrations are listed below.  More information about DOT is available at http://www.dot.gov/about and at the Web sites of each Operating Administration.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)  Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)  Federal Transit Administration (FTA)  Maritime Administration (MARAD)  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)  Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)  Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC)  According to the US Census, the U.S. population is projected to increase to 332 million by 2017, a 70 percent increase since 1967.  The national economy is on the rebound and personal travel continues to increase, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than prior to the 2008 recession.  Industries and consumers depend increasingly on the reliable and timely flow of goods and services within and across our Nation’s borders.  Population growth in cities and mega-regions is placing a strain on existing transportation systems and creating demand for more transportation choices.  As people continue to increase their demand for vibrant communities, creating livable communities with safe, reliable, and affordable transportation choices for all users is essential to ensuring economic vitality and growth. The increasing amount and availability of information, as well as more rapid emergence and adoption of new technologies, is transforming all aspects of our daily life including how we travel to work and spend our leisure time. Utilizing emerging technology, maintaining and improving existing transportation infrastructure, and ensuring multimodal options for the movement of goods and people ensures reliable performance of the transportation system; a system critical to attracting the strong workforce that makes a community thrive.  In response to these trends, this second edition of the DOT strategic plan, Transportation for a New Generation, outlines the approach that we are undertaking to achieve our strategic goals and implement the President’s priorities for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014-2018.  We are acting under the authorities that the Congress and the President have provided the Secretary of Transportation.        "

NSF,National Science Foundation,http://www.nsf.gov,,"History  In 1945, Vannevar Bush, head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, wrote a landmark report, "Science--The Endless Frontier." The report stressed the importance of new scientific knowledge for the economic, social and military well-being of the nation, and that the federal government had the responsibility to see this through. The report recommended the establishment of a foundation to oversee federal funding for basic scientific research and the training of men and women in science. Bush also encouraged actively promoting the international exchange of scientific information. In 1950, Congress passed Public Law 81-507 creating the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NSF has been funding advances and discoveries in science ever since.  NSF: Where Discoveries Begin  NSF's strategic plan for fiscal years 2011 to 2016 defines our vision: "A nation that capitalizes on new concepts in science and engineering (S&E) and provides global leadership in advancing research and education." For more than 60 years, NSF has identified and funded research in new scientific frontiers. Many of the resulting discoveries and technological advances have been truly revolutionary. NSF-funded scientists or research teams discovered many of the fundamental particles of matter, analyzed the cosmic microwaves left over from the earliest epoch of the universe, developed carbon-14 dating of ancient artifacts, decoded the genetics of viruses, and created an entirely new state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.  NSF’s continued commitment to supporting a wide range of scientific fields and disciplines will help secure and sustain U.S. competitiveness and economic growth. Similarly, NSF’s strong support for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at all levels will provide the nation with a globally competitive workforce now and in the future.  NSF-funded research has led to many new technologies that are used on a daily basis like barcodes, the Internet (including the world's first, freely available web browser, Mosaic), and wireless technology that revolutionized the cellphone industry.  NSF also funds major research equipment used by scientists and engineers including giant optical and radio telescopes, Antarctic research stations, high-end computer facilities and ultra-high-speed connections, ships for ocean research, sensitive detectors of very subtle physical phenomena and gravitational wave observatories.  Another essential element in NSF's mission is support for education in science, technology, enginering, and mathematics, from pre-Kindergarten through graduate school and beyond. NSF thoroughly integrates research with education to help ensure that there will always be plenty of skilled people available to work in new and emerging scientific, engineering and technological fields, and plenty of capable teachers to educate the next generation.  In the past few decades, NSF has supported at least 197 Nobel Laureates at some point in their careers—including almost 70 percent of U.S. recipients, as well as other honors too numerous to list.  Promoting partnerships is one of NSF's core strategies. NSF supports collaborative projects with academic institutions, private industry, and state and local government; works closely with other federal agencies in cross-cutting areas of research and education; and supports U.S. participation in international scientific efforts.  NSF By the Numbers   	In 1951, NSF's initial budget was just $225,000. As of fiscal year 2012, NSF's budget is $7.0 billion. 	NSF funds reach all 50 states through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and other institutions. 	NSF is the funding source for approximately 20 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted by America’s colleges and universities. In many fields such as mathematics, computer science and the social sciences, NSF is the major source of federal backing.

NSF-funded scientists or research teams discovered many of the fundamental particles of matter, analyzed the cosmic microwaves left over from the earliest epoch of the universe, developed carbon-14 dating of ancient artifacts, decoded the genetics of viruses, and created an entirely new state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.  NSF’s continued commitment to supporting a wide range of scientific fields and disciplines will help secure and sustain U.S. competitiveness and economic growth.

SBA,Small Business Administration,http://www.sba.gov,,"When, following the suggestion of President Eisenhower, congress passed the Small Business Act and created the U.S. small Business Administration (SBA) in 1953, its stated mission was to “aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns,” and also ensure small businesses a “fair proportion” of government contracts.  Sixty years later, the landscape of the nation has changed substantially, but SBA’s mission and its commitment to the interests of America’s small business remain the same.  During the past six decades, SBA has helped tens of millions of small businesses start, grow and succeed by expanding access to capital, federal contracts, counseling and entrepreneurial education.  In addition, SBA disaster loans have helped more than a million homeowners and renters, and hundreds of thousands of businesses recover and rebuild their lives.  America’s 28 million small business owners are the engine of job creation and economic growth in this country, creating nearly two out of every three net new jobs in the United States, and employing over half of the nation’s workforce.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) ensures that these businesses have the tools and resources they need to start and expand their operations and create good jobs that support a growing economy and strong middle class.  The SBA has a proven track record of assisting America’s small businesses by increasing and improving access to capital, federal contracting opportunities, entrepreneurial development, and disaster assistance.  The Agency also boosts America’s long-term competitiveness by improving the entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure small business owners and entrepreneurs are well positioned to take advantage of new opportunities and new markets as the economy improves.

SSA,Social Security Administration,http://www.ssa.gov,,"Few government agencies reach as many people as we do. The programs we administer provide a financial safety net for millions of Americans. We run one of the Nation’s largest entitlement programs - the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program. We also administer the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides financial support to aged, blind, or disabled adults and children with limited income and resources. In FY 2011, we paid over 60 million people a total of about $770 billion in Social Security benefits and SSI payments.     For more information on all of our programs and benefits, please visit our Understanding the Benefits web page at www.ssa.gov/pubs/10024.html     Our current organization is composed of over 80,000 Federal and State employees. We deliver services through a nationwide network of 1,500 offices that includes regional offices, field offices (including Social Security card centers), teleservice centers, processing centers, hearing offices (including satellite offices and national hearing centers), the Appeals Council, and our headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland. We also have a presence in several United States embassies around the globe.     Our field offices and Social Security card centers are the primary points of contact for in-person interaction with the public. Our teleservice centers primarily handle telephone calls to our National 800 Number. Employees in our processing centers primarily handle Social Security retirement, survivors, and disability payments but also perform a wide range of other functions, which include answering telephone calls to our National 800 Number. We depend on State employees in 54 State and territorial disability determination services to make disability determinations. The administrative law judges in our hearing offices and the Appeals Council make decisions on appeals of denied Social Security and SSI claims. The vast majority of our employees serve the public directly or provide support to employees who do. A chart illustrating our organizational structure and the function of each component is available on our website at www.socialsecurity.gov/org. "
